# Excelerate Mobile Application

## Project Overview

Excelerate Mobile App is a cross-platform application built with Flutter that connects learners with educational programs offered through the Excelerate platform. The app provides an intuitive interface for program discovery, event registration, and feedback collection.

## Project Objectives

This application aims to achieve the following goals:

- Facilitate easy discovery and browsing of available educational programs
- Streamline the registration process for events and workshops
- Enable learners to provide structured feedback on programs
- Provide administrative tools for program management and participant tracking
- Deliver timely notifications about upcoming events and announcements

## Target Users

The application serves two primary user groups:

**Learners**
Learners can browse available programs, view detailed information about courses and workshops, register for events, track their progress, and submit feedback after program completion.

**Administrators**
Administrators have the ability to create and manage programs, post announcements, monitor participant enrollment, collect and analyze feedback, and track engagement metrics.

## Navigation Flow

The application follows a hierarchical navigation structure:
Splash Screen → Login → Home Dashboard → Program Listing → Program Details → Registration/Feedback

Users can navigate back to the home screen at any point using the bottom navigation bar or back button.

## Core Features

**Authentication and Profile Management**
Users can create accounts, log in securely, and manage their personal information and preferences.

**Home Dashboard**
The main screen displays upcoming events, new programs, user progress, and quick access to key sections.

**Program Discovery**
A comprehensive listing of all available programs with search and filtering capabilities based on category, date, and difficulty level.

**Program Details**
Detailed information pages for each program including description, duration, instructor information, schedule, and enrollment capacity.

**Registration System**
Streamlined forms for enrolling in programs with confirmation notifications.

**Feedback Collection**
Post-program surveys and rating systems to gather learner insights.

**Notifications**
Push notifications for event reminders, announcements, and updates.
